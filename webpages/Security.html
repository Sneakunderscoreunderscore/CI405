		<h1>How to keep safe online</h1>
		<!--- ------------------------------------ -->
<h2>What are the risks online?</h2>
	<p>We have already spoken about the risks of having weak passwords and the potential damage cyber criminals can cause by breaking into an account. However, this is not the only part of online security. </p>
	<p> On this page, we will discuss the importance of GENERAL security practices and the potential impact of not following them.</p>
		
	<h3>What is Malware?</h3>
	<p> The first thing someone might think of after account security is the security of their devices. Malware, or a 'virus' as commonly known, is computer code that inserts itself into programs and files on a device in order to complete malicous actions on your device. This could be stealing your information to log into your accounts or deleting your files or as subtle as siphoning the processing power of your systems for themselves. [1]</p>
	<h3> How do I stop malware from infecting my PC? </h3>
	<p> In order to stop malware from effecting you, there are a few security rules to keep in mind. The most important one is to have an antivirus operating on your machine. These don't stop viruses from entering in all cases, but will isolate them from destroying your machine. You do not need anything special. If you are using a Windows computer, then Window's defender is genuinely all you need. Some providers, like Norton, can offer paid services but these are usually only beneficial in extreme circumstance, such as if you are downloading a lot of risky programs. [2] </p>
	<img src="images/CartoonVirus.jpg" alt="Virus"></img>
	<p>The next to do to protect yourself is to make sure you do not click any shady links or download any files from unknown sources. Usually these come from Emails. [3] Friends and family can have their account stolen or proofed. Do not open their files either without confirming they sent you an email through another option, such as a phone call or in person. (Do not use social media services to do this). Downloading movies on shady websites can also lead to this.</p>
	<small>Quick tip!</small>
	<small> You cannot get viruses from just viewing webpages. If this appears when you are browsing, it is fake. The code on the webpage is doing that. (Known as JavaScript) Do not call the number on the pop-up. You can simply close your tab. If it does not let you, try turning off your computer or right clicking your task bar, clicking 'Task Manager' and then right clicking your browser and clicking 'end task'! [4] </small>
	<h3>What should I do if my device is infected with malware?</h3>
	<p>If your device is infected by malware, and the antivirus is a having a very hard time getting rid of it, then it is recommended you backup useful files and restore your computer from factory settings. It can be very problematic to host malware on your PC even if it seems ok for right now. </p>
		
	<h3>What is phishing?</h3>
		
	p>Phishing has been talked about to throughout our website. It is when scammers attempt to ellicit sensitive data or actions from a victim. This is usually by manipulating the user and seeming official or using cheap tricks. It can also happen by consistent communication with the customer to build trust. It is never good to trust someone online enough to give money or personal information to them. The business of scamming is lucrative and is carefully curated to trick you. [5]</p>
	<img src="images/Phishing.jpg" alt="Fish"> </img<
		
	<h3>What are signs of phishing scams?</h3>
	<p>Below I will list all the posisble phishing scams I have seen working for Microsoft:
	<p> A business email like Microsoft asks you to input your password to 'validate your account' or the account will be deleted. The best thing to remember is that it is a security standard will never ask this from a user base. If you need to update your password or check your log-in activity, you should do it directly from the security website. They will also never have an email with an 'urgent!' warning. </p> 
	<p> A person send you a bunch of detials about your account, like passwords. They also tell you they have sent this from their own email, which you can confirm. The best thing to remember is that emails are easily spoofed. (Make the email look like it was sent from somewhere else) Also, they can find this information from leaks, and don't actually have access to your account. I would always reccommend scanning your computer regularly for virsuses and to check your activity pages for your email addresses. If you do both of these, there is no way it could be a real criminal in your account. NEVER give them what they are asking. This is known as extortion and is a serious crime. If someone is extorting you with legit means, do not contact support, contact your local police. </p>
	<p> A company sends you an email requesting you to log-in to their site or call their phone number. As said before, emails can be spoofed. There also many tools that can make websites look the same as official websites. Never trust them. Always log-in from your own browser search and call from the 'Contact Us' page. </p>
	<p> A threatening call comes to your phone number saying you owed or are owed money. They might even give your name. This is also a scam. Especially do not let anyone connect to your computer unless officially from a reputable company. They will never call you to do this. Your bank will also never call you to confirm over the phone or have you log-in to you online banking. </p>
		
	<p> Here is an example: </p>
	<img src="images/ExamplesOfPhishing.jpg" alt="Phishing">
		
	<small> What is the takeaway? </small>
	<small> No emails can be trusted, if a compnay finds something important, there will be a system in place from their main app or website to fix it. </small>
		
	<h3> How do I test my new knowledge? </h3>
	<p> I'm so glad you asked. Below, we have created a quiz-type game that will allow you to test out what you have learnt. </p>

	<h2>The dangers of Artifical Intelligence in Cyber Security:</h2>
	<p>There are many different forms of AI. Some are 'simple', in that they are very very specialised to one field. For example, some AI's are used to crack passwords in a faster and better way than the normally used programs. Whilst generative AI's like ChatGPT can be used for a lot broader intentions - such as powerful social engineering attempts, since they can be used to create very deceiving narratives. [6]
	</p>
	<p> AI bots built to deceive and steal from users have already been produced such as FraudGPT. [7] It is more important than ever to be careful and to only ever listen to someone who can truly prove they're real.
	</p>
	<p> AI will also help the ease-of-access for low-level criminals to figure out how to produce mroe effective campaigns and hacking tools.[8] The more AI develops the more extreme these cases will become. 
	</p>
	<h2>It isn't all bad!</h2>
	<p>AI is also used to protect you. AI is used in your filters to remove phishing attacks and is also used to protect from fraud in banking. The development of AI systems is important in many wats, but it is also important to understand the risks.</p>
