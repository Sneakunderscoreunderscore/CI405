	<h1> Password Management: </h1>
		
        <!--main page content-->
        <main>

	<h2>Why have a good password? </h2>
	
	<p> Passwords are a first line of defense for your online security. Although it may seem unimportant, since you use them all the time, if your password is easily guessable it can cause serious issues for your entire cyber-profile. </p>
	
	<p> Using weak passwords can make it easy for cyber criminal to use systems that can guess your password using automatic attempting systems.  </p>
	
    <h2>How do they crack my password?</h2>
    
    <p> A common argument for why someone does not care for their password is that 'it is very hard to guess' or 'no one will ever guess it'. This is a wrong way to understand password security. Cyber criminals are not attacking you specifically nor are they making one guess at a time. </p>
    
    <p> Bad actors will use viruses they have spread to other computers to make attempts to crack your passwords. Each of these users will have a tool that will try many combinations very quickly. If you imagine your password as a door with a key lock, it would be like having hundreds of people attempting thousands of keys all at the same time. It is going to fit eventually. </p>
    
    <p> If you use the same password for each website, then all it takes is one person to find your key and get into all your accounts. Passwords saved onto wsites like Roblox or itch.io can be stolen during data leaks which is another way of finding the key to your door. </p>
    
	<h2>What happens if they break in? </h2>
	
	<p> If a bad actor breaks into your acount, depending on what it is, it can be quite bad. If they break into your email account they would be able to change your password and lock you out completley. They could then steal all of your accounts linked to the account and try their best to take all your valuable data such as family member details and bank account detials. They can then use your account to send emails to your friends that spread viruses or threaten their own security. </p>
	
	<h2>How do I make a secure password? </h2>
	
	<p> Thankfully, security is a big field. First and foremost, it is important to ensure you have a password that is not easily guessable, and is different for each account you have. It is a standard for each site to gurantee your password is secure, with a long enough length and enough different characters to make it hard to guess. However, making the letters you use random and symbols different can make it even harder for criminals to guess your password.</p>
	
	<p> A system which is approved by Microsoft is to choose an object in your area that you would see when you're likely to access the account. If you're at school next to a window, you could choose 'window' and then make each other letter capital: 'WiNdOw'. This is known as camel-cases and can make it harder to guess. Then, you can count the amount of windows and screens in your class and give that as your numbers: 'WiNdOw23'. Now you need some special characters! We like to have a system for our characters which is a queue. I can use the numbers I gave as what symbol to use. If I have a mental list of characters such as: '.', '!', '#', '?' then I would use '!' and '#'. All in all, I now have a hard-to-guess, easy-to-remember password: 'WiNdOw23!#'! 
	</p>
	<h2>How to protect my account more? </h2>
	
	<p> I am glad you asked! Just as important for security as a password is two-step verification. This means that a user must verify themselves with a password and another device to prove their identity. Usually this is an email address or phone number. This makes it significantly harder for a criminal to crack. If a password is a door, then the two-step is a dog ready to greet you! 
	</p>
	
	<p> Two-step verification is not a reason to give up on good security practices. If you go to the wrong web page or install a virus then criminals can bypass your two-step verification. You should also have more than one form of verification connected to the account. (Microsoft reccommends atleast 3).
