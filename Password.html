		<h1>How to manage your passwords</h1>
		<!--- ------------------------------------ -->
		<h2>Why have a good password? </h2>
	
	<p> Passwords are a first line of defence for your online security. Although it may seem unimportant, since you use them all the time, if your password is easily guessable it can cause serious issues for your <tag> entire </tag> internet usage.</p>
	
	<p> Using weak passwords can make it easy for cyber criminal to use systems that can guess your password using automatic tools that make attempts for them.  </p>
	
    <h2>How do they crack my password?</h2>
    
    <p> A common argument for why someone does not care for their password is that 'it is very hard to guess' or 'no one will ever guess it'. This is a wrong way to understand password security. Cyber criminals are not attacking you specifically nor are they making one guess at a time. </p>
    
    <p></p>
    
   <p>If you use the same password for each website, then all it takes is one person to find your key and get into all your accounts. Passwords saved onto sites like <tag>Roblox</tag> or <tag>Itch.io</tag> can be stolen during data breaks which is another way of finding the key to your door. [2] </p>

	<h2>What happens if they break in? </h2>
	
	<p> If a criminal breaks into your acount, depending on what it is, it can be quite bad. If they break into your email account they would be able to change your password and lock you out completely. They could then steal all of your services linked to the account and try their best to take all your valuable data such as family member details and bank account details. They can then use your account to send emails to your friends that spread viruses or threaten their own security. This is known as <tag> Identity Theft </tag>. [3] </p>

	<h2>How do I make a secure password? </h2>
<p> Thankfully, security is a big field. First and foremost, it is important to ensure you have a password that is not easily guessable, and is different for each account you have. It is a standard for each site to guarantee your password is secure; with a long enough length and enough different characters to make it hard to guess. However, making the letters you use random and the symbols different can make it even harder for criminals to guess your password.</p>
	
	<p> A system which is approved by Microsoft is to choose an object in your area that you would see when you're likely to access the account. If you're at school next to a window, you could choose 'window' and then make each other letter capital: 'WiNdOw'. This is known as camel-cases and can make it harder to guess. Then, you can count the amount of windows and screens in your class and give that as your numbers: 'WiNdOw23'. Now you need some special characters! We like to have a system for our characters which is a queue. I can use the numbers I gave as what symbol to use. If I have a mental list of characters such as: '.', '!', '#', '?' then I would use '!' and '#'. All in all, I now have a hard-to-guess, easy-to-remember password: 'WiNdOw23!#'! Please keep in mind, this password is still to short. You can add more than one word to make it the recommended 12 characters long. 
	</p>
	<P> You could also use the <tag> West Bends </tag> ideas like "Create a [longer] word using a couple of small words. "My dog Odie" might become "MyDogOdie." 
	    Or : "Take a word or phrase and remove the vowels from it. "Fly like an eagle" becomes "flylkngl.""[4]
	    
	</p>

	<p>
	You can test your password using our tool here:
	</p>
	<p>
	  <a href="PasswordCheck.html"> - Check your Password - </a>
	</p>
	<p> I am glad you asked! Just as important for security as a password is two-step verification. This means that a user must verify themselves with a password and another device to prove their identity. Usually this is an email address or phone number. This makes it significantly harder for a criminal to crack. If a password is a door, then the two-step is a dog ready to greet the criminal! [5]
	</p>
	
	<p> Two-step verification is not a reason to give up on good security practices. If you go to the wrong web page or install a virus then criminals can get through your two-step verification. You should also have more than one form of verification connected to the account. (Microsoft recommends at least 3).
