	<h1> Privacy in business information systems </h1>
		
        <!--main page content-->
        <main>
			<p>As you begin your journey through secondary school, you'll encounter more complex uses of technology, not just in your personal life but also in various business environments. It's important to understand how privacy is managed in business information systems and why it matters. Here’s a straightforward guide to get you started.</p>
		
		<h2>What are business information systems?</h2>
		
			<p>Business Information Systems (BIS) are the backbone of today's companies. They include the software and hardware that businesses use to organize, manage, and analyze data. This can range from customer databases and financial records to communication systems and more.</p>

		<h2>Why is privacy important in business information systems?</h2>
		
			<p>1. Personal Data Protection: Businesses often handle sensitive information, including customers' details (like names, addresses, and payment information). Protecting this information is super important to prevent identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access.</p>

			<p>2. Compliance with Laws: Many countries have strict laws and regulations to ensure that businesses handle personal data responsibly. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe sets guidelines for data protection and privacy.</p>

			<p>3. Trust and Reputation: Companies that fail to protect privacy can lose customer trust and face significant reputation damage, which can lead to them losing their business.</p>

      		<h2> How does AI handle private information and how to properly use it</h2>
		
			<p>AI recently skyrocketed in popularity as a tool used by individuals and companies alike. This spike in popularity has caused a lot of confusion towards their policies. It is important to note that different companies will have different policies, just because one AI engine uses your information in one way, doesn’t mean another will use it the same way. </p>
          		
			<p>ChatGPT, currently the most popular AI tool, is designed to prioritize your privacy and doesn't store your conversations after they end. Although ChatGPT tries not to keep personal data, using it with classified or sensitive business information isn't recommended since it's made for general use and might not meet specific industry standards for data security. Legally, OpenAI, the company that owns ChatGPT, follows privacy laws like GDPR in Europe, which protect personal data, but these don't specifically cover classified business information. This is why businesses try to use certain templates to continue using the AI tool without giving away any of their classified information.</p>
			
			<p>For example, Brenda wants to save time while writing an email to her colleagues about some classified information by using ChatGPT. Because she is dealing with sensitive information that would be a risk to the company if it were available to the public, Brenda has decided to use a template to write the email she wants, without providing the AI with any of that information. Below is the template that ChatGPT provided, thanks to this, Brenda wrote her email without giving the AI’s database any of the company's sensitive information.</p>

		<h2>Key privacy threats in business systems</h2>

			<p>- Data Breaches: Imagine if someone managed to sneak into a company's computer system without permission and took a bunch of important information, like customer names, addresses, and payment details. This is called a data breach. It's like someone breaking into a store and stealing stuff, but instead of taking physical items, they steal information. In a business setting, this can be a big problem because it can lead to customers losing trust in the company, and the company might also have to pay money because they didn't keep the information safe. </p>

			<p>- Insider Threats: Sometimes, the threat comes from within the organization - An insider threat in a business setting is like having a team member who either purposely or accidentally does something that can hurt the team. This could be an employee who has access to important information and either leaks it on purpose or makes a mistake that exposes the company's data. </p>

			<p>- Phishing Attacks: This occurs when someone pretends to be a trustworthy person to trick employees into giving away important information. Businesses are often targeted by phishing schemes designed to trick employees into giving away access keys or sensitive information. </p>

		<h2>What you can do</h2>

		<p>Be Informed: Learn about the important laws and best practices around data privacy. Understanding your rights can empower you to protect yourself. Some laws that might be important for you to learn about might include:</p>
		
			<p>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) - This law ensures websites don’t take any information from kids under the age of 13 without their parents’ consent.</p>
			<p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - This is a big set of rules used in many countries that helps protect your information. It makes sure you can ask companies what information they have about you and even tell them to delete it if you want.</p>
			<p>Privacyrights.org have an amazing website that breaks down and clarifies privacy rights. You can access their website through the following link: https://privacyrights.org/</p>
		
		<p>Practice Safe Computing: Use strong passwords (go use our password checker to practice or ensure your passwords are safe enough to use), be wary of suspicious emails, and understand the privacy settings on your own devices and accounts.</p>
