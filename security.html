	<h2>What are the risks online?</h2>
	<p>	We have already spoken about the risks of having weak passwords and the potential damage cyber criminals can cause by breaking into an account. However, this is not the only part of online security. </p>
    <p> On this page, we will discuss the importance of GENERAL security practices and the potential impact of not following them.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
    <p> The first thing someone might think of after account security is the security of their devices. Malware, or a 'virus' as commonly known, is computer code that inserts itself into programs and files on a device in order to complete malicous actions on your device. This could be stealing your information to log into your accounts or deleting your files or as subtle as siphoning the processing power of your systems for themselves.</p>
    <p> How do I stop malware from infecting my PC? </p>
    <p> In order to stop malware from effecting you, there are a few security rules to keep in mind. The most important one is to have an antivirus operating on your machine. These don't stop viruses in most cases, but will isolate them from destroying your machine. You do not need anything special. If you are using a Windows computer, then Window's defender is genuinely all you need. Some providers, like Norton, can offer paid services but these are usually only beneficial in extreme circumstance, such as if you are downloading a lot of programs you shouldn't be. </p>
    <p>The next to do to protect yourself is to make sure you do not click any shady links or download any files from unknown sources. Friends and family can have their account stolen or proofed. Do not open their files either without confirming they sent you an email through another medium, such as a phone call or in person. (Do not use social media services to do this). Downloading movies on shady websites can also lead to this.</p>
    <small>Quick tip! You cannot get viruses from webpages. If this appears when you are browsing, it is fake. The code on the webpage is doing that. (Known as JavaScript) Do not call the number on the pop-up. You can simply close your tab. If it does not let you, try turning off your computer or right clicking your task bar, clicking 'Task Manager' and then right clicking your browser and clicking 'end task'!  </small>
